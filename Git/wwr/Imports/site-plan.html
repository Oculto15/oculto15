      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>My main idea is to create a website where I can tech people how to import. I want to have courses where people can enter and have some videos explaining the topic, test, a section to make questions, a bar where they can see all the progress. Have you ever thought of creating your own business by importing products but don't know how to do it? You know what products to import but don't know how to find manufacturers or import services? These questions and many more I would like to solve through a web page with the necessary information.</p>


      <section class="content">
      <p>Your Personal Site Content


       <p> Why will people come to your site?</p>
        
        <p> Start importing</p>
        <p>People will come to my site to find mor information about imports and how can they start doing this.
          Process</p>
        <p>They will find information about all the principal process they have to do in order to be able to import what they need to their country
          Important concepts</p>
        <p>Also, they will have a complete knowledge about the important concepts, words, papers, where they can find good sellers, etcâ€¦</p>
        
        <p> What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?</p>
        <ul>
         
          <p>Probably, they will have questions about:</p>
          <li>-What do I need to do to import?</li>
          <li>-Where can I find the products?</li>
          <li>-How much money do I need to start importing?</li>
          <li>-What are all the process that I must go through?</li>
          <li>-How do I know if they are reseller and wholesaler?</li>
          <li>-Is it better to ship by sea or air?</li>
          <li>-Do I have to know English to be able to import? (Spanish audience)</li>
          <li>-What concepts do I have to learn?</li>
      </ul>
        
        <p>What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?</p>

        
        <p>Whole process of learning</p>
        <p>They would like to have a way to learned what they want to do, in my case, I want to have a course where they can have videos, questions, exams, a place to ask question, everything what they need to know from the beginning.</p>
        
       <p> What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?</p>
        
       <p> Organized information</p>
        <p>First of all, I must have all this information to be able to construct a website where people can come and find the information needed.</p>
        <p>Page structure</p>
        <p>Second, I have to define very well how the structure of every page should be. </p>
        
        
        
        <p>Videos, concepts, process</p>
        <p>Third, I need to create explanatory videos about the important concepts, these videos must be accurate, with good content, graphic animations that explain certain processes clearly and a suitable environment where they are recorded. (These videos will probably be recorded later when I have the page created and well organized.)</p>
        
        <p>Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?</p>
        
        <p>Unique</p>
        <p>I know there is a lot of competition about this topic, but I intend to have the best page and content so that people can learn with clarity, have a nice visual that allows them to concentrate on what they are learning. Have a good follow-up system that allows them to see where they are and how far they are from finishing, knowledge tests, so they can be sure they are learning well.</p>
